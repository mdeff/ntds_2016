One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? I win an election easily, a great ""movement"" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state! Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!

The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!

Trump won't attend daily U.S. intelligence briefings. Apparently, they're a schedule conflict with his Russian intelligence briefings. Trump has appointed a third Goldman Sachs executive to his economic team. One more and we get a free financial crisis! ""Survivor"" creator Mark Burnett may help with Trump's inaugural. Makes sense — Trump was elected by the Tribal Council. A former WWE exec will serve in Trump's administration. God, I hope his presidency is also staged. Michael Flynn's son got fired from Trump's transition team today for spreading fake news. Look forward to seeing him regularly on @CNN! RT @colbertlateshow: Tonight! Stephen and Joe call a Family Meeting! #LSSC @VP https://t.co/tUzxRbnxeB A quick preview of my 2016 year in review. https://t.co/96XDd4RCwu Dinner ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Company 👹 https://t.co/Kq8OSIvW1d They say the camera adds 10 pounds so if you watch tonight's show closely, you'll see I hired two new camera operators. Elaine Chao has been picked for Transportation Secretary. She'll be in charge of all the busses that Trump throws people under. Today is #GivingTuesday. In addition to donating to your favorite charity, try giving zero fucks about Trump's tweets! Trump’s #CyberMonday special: all tweets only 20% fact-checked! It’s good to tell each family member what to bring to Thanksgiving dinner. That way two people don't show up with the same racist opinions. There is a good chance that Trump will appoint his Thanksgiving turkey as Secretary of the Tremendous Yum Zone. President Obama will pardon his last turkey tomorrow. But stay tuned for Thanksgiving 2017 when President Trump pardons a journalist. Oh joy https://t.co/Buc2uW4cdW Trump's cabinet is like a dream team of people who have never heard MLK's dream. Pence, Bannon, Sessions, Pompeo, Flynn, Priebus. Not sure Trump knows that, traditionally, you only need 4 horsemen. You and three friends still have a chance to join @iamjohnoliver &amp; me this Saturday! Auction ends in a few hours. https://t.co/Aa6jlAqmyu Senate Democrats have hinted they might work with Donald Trump on issues like infrastructure, maternity leave, and not being jailed on Day 4 Apparently drinking a beer a day reduces the risk of stroke. Turns out I've been drinking since Tuesday for health reasons. The spectacular Supermoon makes me ponder the existential questions of the universe, like whether I could exist in it for the next 4 years. Donald Trump chose Steve Bannon as his new chief advisor. It's a rare example where two wrongs actually do make the Right. Ah, love! https://t.co/KKrPuFcpgq RT @contextual_life: Guess who's on @colbertlateshow tonight? #WatchTheBern https://t.co/JqLTQMdAGa Gosh, I can't wait to see how I felt about it! https://t.co/KIsTj7WH7D You know, when you really think about it, I don't recommend you think about it. Wait a second… What's this doing here? Live #LSSC tonight! #Vote https://t.co/F6XZwINsQN Poor @realDonaldTrump can't use his own Twitter anymore! NYT calls him 'anxious,' staff calls him liability! Plus he'll never see this! Sad! Good luck to all marathoners! I'm not running, but in support, I will be carbo-loading and rubbing Vaseline on my nipples. Trump isn’t planning a big celebration for Tuesday night. Just one more way the GOP won't have a party after this election. W Wow Cubs win! Congrats Chicago - see you in 2124! I'd like buy the movie rights to game 7, please. #GoCubbies #raindelayinmypants Hey! Wanna see me &amp; John Oliver on stage, post-election, either talking &amp; laughing or holding each other &amp; weeping? https://t.co/DJAvwT4dEu Movie theaters are showing live election results. If Trump wins, they'll just segue right into The Hunger Games. They're changing the peach emoji so it won't look like a butt? Kiss my 🍑, Unicode 9.0. I tried to put as much thought into this tweet about James Comey as he put into his letter to Congress. The end. Happy Halloween! Otherwise known as the second-scariest night of the next two weeks. Remember: if you #GoVote now, you don't have to watch any more ads! Early voting info from @HeadCountOrg:… https://t.co/SCmQtnxwmP And now, an important message from my fake office. #LSSC https://t.co/GWgkKM2ns5 RT @colbertlateshow: Halloween means one thing: aggressively broadcasting your sexuality. Let these costume ideas take your game up a notch… Experts say the wage gap won’t close until 2186, probably around the same time women perfect asexual reproduction and toss us in the ocean. Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed, so I guess you can't get away with everything if you're a star. My finest work... https://t.co/a33kGH5TgB Emma Watson wrote a note urging Americans to vote. She didn't spend her childhood fighting a dark lord so we could elect one. Hey, look!

RT @colbertlateshow: Tonight! @TomHanks, your wish is granted... #LSSC https://t.co/JaVDOOs1Qh Bernie Sanders said the media would find mean comments about Hillary if he got hacked. Luckily, his campaign shredded all of his telegrams. OK. Let's Get this over with! Dunston was SS, I flipped him with Dawson. Everybody calm down, and #GoCubs Trump mocked a porn star who accused him of assault. Odd he's so judgmental, given that he built his brand by screwing people. Trump's lawyer has asked that his campaign statements be excluded from the Trump University trial. And ideally, also from history. We've got @TigerWoods and @ElijahWood on the same show, it's gonna be a great one! Knock on Wood(s)! https://t.co/clhwEwbgin Trump says Clinton's tax plan would double everyone's taxes. Which in Trump's case would still be zero. Halloween costume idea: Chris Christie Brinkley. POTUS told Trump to 'stop whining' about the elections. Might be tough since Donald doesn't seem to know what 'stop' means. RT @colbertlateshow: Tonight! We welcome back Melania Trump and whoever she's looking at. #LSSC https://t.co/sDcnFzhPz4 Tom Brady said he's going to vote. No word on who he’s voting for, but given his love of deflated leathery balls... TrumpTV show idea. ""Rigged"" - Donald Trump fails at things and blames everybody but himself. Anyone care for a snack with POTUS? Tonight...https://t.co/C4UwjyXxtU RT @ConanOBrien: Visit https://t.co/dijqtd60YL to help honor my friend Robin Williams' passion for cycling and giving. https://t.co/aL65jrH… Trump said his campaign could be his ""single greatest waste of time, of energy &amp; money."" Congrats, Donald! Today you are a Trump U graduate. Hey, if you're hiring, this guy's looking for a new gig. Watch #LSSC Monday for more. https://t.co/FqMB7zKj6o Colin Kaepernick will start for the 49ers on Sunday. This is the biggest Sunday loss for Trump supporters since the last debate.

John Berger remembered – by Geoff Dyer, Olivia Laing, Ali Smith and Simon McBurney https://t.co/wtdjuEIhH9 @JoshRadnor this is basically summer still. @reaganart angstfaustenuppercasen One day I will wrap an umbrella with the little snap facing the right direction on the first try.

I may not have espn -- but there's fight in the air for 2017. @lizzieohreally Me? 2016, you advent calendar of crap, you have one day left. I want locusts. Here's to another year of Instagramming deck chairs on the Titanic! @SadieStein I once tortured a boy in college by reading all of Michael Cunningham's White Angel over the phone. No regrets. Law &amp; Order Basic Victims Unit: Looks like *someone* got more spice in her latte than she bargained for. Ain't that right, Officer La Croix? If your photo caption includes the phrase ""off the grid!"", you're not. Like how if you can say ""Heimlich,"" you don't need it. @ellerylong she really does but the story is from when they were teenagers so...no more Judy 😐 Land speed record: one martini before my mother told the story of how liza minnelli beat her out for the role of Anne Frank in high school. @amandafortini Addendum: slap bracelets, giant Swatch watches, tiny answering machine tapes, Sun-in I'm the kind of badass who eats a sandwich while on the phone with a highly sensitive automated options system. Fucking Bushwick. What a lady. If you want to post pictures of your kidself dressed as Princess Leia, now is the time. That's not glomming, that's the point. All I want for Christmas is world peace. But a nice stocking stuffer would be Trump's password so I can quietly start liking @ACLU posts. RT @bazecraze: Christmas cards with glitter on them are a nice way to say ""Merry Christmas but also fuck off a little bit."" @xlorentzen 3) water damage can skip apartment ceilings @jaybulger If you die, I'll do your funeral playlist. #friendship Pregnancy tests you pee on but instead of lines it says ""novel,"" ""painting,"" ""pilot,"" ""interconnected stories,"" ""don't quit your day job..."" @friedgal @KateVitt They're 22 hours ahead so you have time to catch up on viewings. Me at the beginning of 2016: Posting clever before/after photos. Me at the end of 2016: Nothing. Remember how pharmacies used to make us sign a ledger when we picked up prescriptions? I wish I read anything as fast as I read that list. For future reference, when I say ""let's do this Lady and The Tramp style,"" it means split a bowl of pasta. That's it. @jacobwe Though he probably wants to go now but can't because he said he wouldn't and therefore will but then will have to not once again. Scared of missing flight woke up @ 4am thinking this classic: ""Maybe I'll do this always &amp; train 2 be surprisingly agile old figure skater."" No nerves have ever been as frayed as mine were on this night. Happy birthday, Joan. Twitter-free national treasure. https://t.co/ztP0AMWKf9 @Borisk driving it, obviously TMZ tour bus driving by The Chateau Marmont, defining it as the place where ""Josh Hartnett suffered explosive diarrhea."" I can't wait for this year to be over. The whole Ryan Lochte fake mugging thing was a real stain on 2016. ""We were perhaps not so unlovable as we had come to believe."" George Saunders. Lincoln in The Bardo. A ray of 2017 light. @mattspangler Spanglahaus @skeery Kicker of the century. You're not really living your worst life until you have your face blurred on a viral video. If you are an American Muslim, know that American Jews have your back on this and will speak out. This is not that poem. @Shteyngart I took all my black-squiggle-on-dead-tree classes there.

Upsides: Business booming for bars. Being reminded of Dave Chappelle's genius. The ability to cry on command. Getting Trump out of New York. The surprisingly dulcet sound of German sanity. https://t.co/ray47c7TBc The nation's food diary for this week would read like a dare. The NY Observer gave me a home when The Voice axed it's essay section. Years later they put a nice feature-sized target on my back. RIP❤️🗽🗞 Only in America could a man whose staff took away his Twitter account be given the nuclear codes. -- @VanityFair @espiers FBIC Turns out we had an allotted amount of justice in 2016 and we used it up on the Cubs victory. 9/12/2001, 11/05/2008, 11/09/2016: The days I've witnessed a city of strangers think the same thing. Only one was joy - one will be again. Women of America: We will always love you even if you don't love yourself. Signed, The Coastal Bubbles @superlau77 yes. 😐 I thought you were kidding. I thought it was a joke. I even wrote it down in my diary. ""America had a very funny joke today.""
