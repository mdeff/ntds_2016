Because [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython), the Python reference implementation, [interprets the language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) (i.e. it compiles Python code to intermediate bytecode which is then interpreted by a virtual machine), it is inherentably slower than [compiled languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language), especially for computation heavy tasks such as number crunching.\n",

    "1. Compile Python to machine code.\n",
    "1. Implement in a compiled language and call from Python.\n",
